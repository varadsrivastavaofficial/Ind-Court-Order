# **App Name**: IndCourtOrder AI

## Core Features:

- Input Collection: Collect user input for Target Name, Location (City/State - India), Grievance Type (Noise, Harassment, Property, Nuisance, Other), and Incident Description.
- AI-Powered Legal Text Generation: Generate realistic judicial-style legal text, referencing IPC sections in an authoritative manner. It will reason, as a tool, to determine which sections to cite. The output should mimic formal, cold, judicial, and professional tone with no conversational language.
- Document Preview: Display a real-time preview of the generated legal document in an A4 ratio, resembling a printed paper with a subtle shadow and initial 'AWAITING INPUT' watermark. It is an exercise in creating a static site with advanced HTML formatting.
- Visual Authority Elements: Incorporate generic typography-based emblems that resemble official Indian court seals, stamps, and emblems, to enhance the document's visual authority. These should stand-in, place-holder symbols, and avoid using real court names, judges, case numbers, or logos.
- PDF Export: Enable one-click download of the generated document as a print-ready PDF, complete with proper margins, headers, footers, and pagination to appear suitable for physical printing.
- Theme Toggle: Allow users to toggle between light and dark modes for comfortable viewing.

## Style Guidelines:

- Color scheme: Light mode with a white background (#FFFFFF), black text (#000000), and red accents (#D4212B) for an authoritative feel. Dark mode features a near-black background (#121212), white text (#FFFFFF), and the same red accents (#D4212B).
- UI Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean, executive feel in the user interface.
- Document Font: 'Literata' (serif) for a formal, court-style document layout.
- Two-panel layout: Left panel for input fields, right panel for document preview.
- Prominent red primary action button with serious hover and focus states.
- Restrained transitions and subtle hover effects that maintain a serious tone.
